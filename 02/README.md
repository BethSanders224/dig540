## Week 2 - Data Curation

Now we'll look more closely at the vocabulary file we created last week, turning it into a data feed. Then we'll use our hosting accounts to make a web page out of the feed.

**Assignment**

All parts of the assignment are discussed in the intro video above.

Part 1: Upstream sync your dig540 repository with the main repository.

Part 2: Read *What are the important differences between DAM and CMS?* by Casey Schmidt: <https://www.canto.com/blog/dam-vs-cms/>.

Part 3: In Slack, write a blurb about a Digital Asset Management or Content Management System that you are familiar with, and how it is being used by you or others. Be critical of the software if lacks certain features, or glowing about it if it meets your needs. 

Part 4: Create a simple dynamic web page based on the "vocabulary.json" data feed:
- Locate "vocabulary.json" in your dig540 repository;
- Locate the 'raw' feed of "vocabulary.json" by following the "raw" button, make note of the URL;
- In Visual Studio Code, create vocabulary.php and save to your local filesystem;
- Edit the new vocabulary.php file with the code from the video (the video will show each line of the code written by hand... feel free to follow along but I'll also post the completed code block to Slack so that you can double check your work);
- Upload vocabulary.php to your Reclaim hosting account;
- Once uploaded, find your new web page at **[your domain name]/vocabulary.php**, and paste this new URL into Slack;

Congrats, you've made your first dynamic web page! 

If you run into any problems, make sure to ask questions on Slack!

**The assignment should be done by Wednesday Sept. 15th.**
