Part 1: Say "hi" in Slack.

Part 2: Create or re-familiarize yourself with your Reclaim Hosting account (or another hosting account if you have one).

Part 3: Install or re-famimliarize yourself with Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>, the editor we will be using this semester for text and code files.

Part 4: Create or re-familiarize yourself with your GitHub account. Then, fork the <https://github.com/craigdietrich/dig540> repository. Once the fork is created, send me the link to your fork as a direct message in Slack. Clone your fork onto your local computer. Then, In Visual Studio Code, edit the vocabulary.txt file like I did in the video, then sync it bac to GitHub. Finally, create a pull request so I can see your new vocabulary term and merge it to the main branch.

**The assignment should be done by Wednesday Sept. 8th.**
