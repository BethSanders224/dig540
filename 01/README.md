## Week 1 - Setup

This week is all about getting the environments set up: Slack, GitHub, and Reclaim (or another hosting account if you have one). The video below will show you how to create the accounts and download the software you'll need throughout this semester. If you run into any problems just ask for help in Slack.

**This Week's Video**

- Introduction to DIG540: 

**Links**


**Assignment**

Install the software in the videos and create your GitHub account. Then, fork the <http://github.com/novomancy/dig540> repository. Once the fork is created, send me the link to your fork as a direct message in Slack. Clone your fork onto your local computer and edit the vocabulary.txt file like I did in the video, then sync it back to GitHub. (It may ask for an account and password when you try to sync; just use the GitHub account you created.) The end result should be that your fork will have one more file than the master. Finally, create a pull request so I can see your new vocabulary term.

Also, set up your Reclaim account or let me know if you have another hosted environment already. I'm happy to answer any questions about this.

**The assignment should be done by Wednesday Sept. 8th.**
